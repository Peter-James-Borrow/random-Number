# Random-Number
The aim of this project was to learn and understand the fundamentals of web development by making a small interactive game that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. On every turn the app provides the user with feedback telling them when they are wrong and displaying the number they guessed allowing the user to guess again untill their turns expire.
